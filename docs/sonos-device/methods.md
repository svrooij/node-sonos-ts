## Shortcuts

Each **Sonos Device** has the following shortcuts (things you could also do by using one of the exposed services):

- **.GetNightMode()** - Get NightMode status (playbar)
- **.GetSpeechEnhancement()** - Get Speech enhancement status (playbar)
- **.GetZoneGroupState()** - Get current group info.
- **.GetZoneInfo()** - Get info about current player.
- **.Play()** - Start playing *.
- **.Pause()** - Pause playing *.
- **.Next()** - Go to next song (when playing the queue) *.
- **.Previous()** - Go to previous song (when playing the queue) *.
- **.SetNightMode(desiredState)** - Turn on/off nightmode on your playbar.
- **.SetRelativeVolume(adjustment)** - Change the volume relative to current.
- **.SetSpeechEnhancement(desiredState)** - Turn on/off speech enhancement on your playbar.
- **.SetVolume(newVolume)** - Change the volume.
- **.Stop()** - Stop playing (most of the time it's better to pause playback) *.
- **.SeekPosition('0:03:01')** - Go to other postion in track *.
- **.SeekTrack(3)** - Go to other track in the queue *.

These operations (marked with `*`) are send to the coordinator if the device is created by the **SonosManager**. So you can send **.Next()** to each device in a group and it will be send to the correct device.

## Content

You can also browse content, see [content.js](https://github.com/svrooij/node-sonos-ts/blob/master/examples/content.js), these are actually all shortcuts to the browse method.

- **.GetFavoriteRadioShows()** - Get your favorite radio shows
- **.GetFavoriteRadioStations()** - Get your favorite radio stations
- **.GetFavorites()** - Get your favorite songs
- **.GetQueue()** - Get the current queue.

## Metadata

This library can guess the required metadata for certain track uri's. This is done by the [MetadataHelper](https://github.com/svrooij/node-sonos-ts/blob/master/src/helpers/metadata-helper.ts). The "guessed" metadata is tested [here](https://github.com/svrooij/node-sonos-ts/blob/master/tests/helpers/metadata-helper.test.ts). If you want to extend this you'll need Wireshark. Set it up to monitor `port 1400`, execute the required action in the sonos app (on the same pc as wireshark) and look for `POST /MediaRenderer/AVTransport/Control`.

Currently supported url's for metadata guessing:

- `apple:album:1025210938` - Apple Music album (not in user's music library).
- `apple:libraryalbum:l.OIdA15a` - Apple Music album from user's music library.
- `apple:libraryplaylist:p.rQ5rCxE48W` - Apple Music playlist from user's music library.
- `apple:librarytrack:i.m3g9uLvzB7` - Apple Music track from user's music library.
- `apple:playlist:pl.cf589c8b40dc40cd9ddc2e61493d5efd` - Apple Music playlist (not in user's music library).
- `apple:track:1025212410` - Apple Music track (not in user's library).
- `deezer:album:123456` - A Deezer album by id

This library will guess the metadata automatically for the following methods, but you can also use the **MetadataHelper**, yourself.

- `sonosDevice.AddUriToQueue(...)` - Adding track to queue.
- `sonosDevice.SetAVTransportURI(...)` - Switch transport (cannot be used to play 'containers' like playlists, albums, ...)
